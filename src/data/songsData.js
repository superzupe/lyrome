    lyrics: `
In the dark I see a shadow
Moving closer, heartbeats echo
Black mamba whispers in my mind
Calling me to cross the line

Fear and fire, neon lights
Lost between the day and night
Searching for a way to be
Breaking chains to set me free

Step into the next dimension
Rising higher, no prevention
Every beat is pushing through
Next level calling me and you

Voices loud, the future bright
Shining stars in endless night
Dreams collide and worlds expand
Take my hand, we’ll make a stand

Savage hearts, electric fire
Burning strong, we climb up higher
No regrets, we break away
Living wild in night and day

Echoes roar, the battle starts
Courage flows through beating hearts
Standing tall, we won’t disguise
Savage truth behind our eyes

Voices rising in a song
Every step, a brand new way
Shining brighter every day

Boundless hope and energy

Drama plays upon the stage
Turning hearts and turning page
Every moment, every scene
Hidden truths and what they mean

Curtains fall, the lights ignite
Stories told in black and white
Drama lives within our soul
Acting out to make us whole

Illusion fades, reality
Shadows dancing endlessly
Lost inside a crystal dream
Nothing ever what it seems

Colors shift, the mirror breaks
Every choice is what we make
Illusion calls, but I will stay
Finding truth along the way

Life’s too short to waste away
Chasing shadows every day
Take the chance, don’t be afraid
Memories are what we made

Smiles we share, the time we keep
Moments strong and feelings deep
Life’s too short, so let it be
Living now, just you and me

Armageddon shakes the ground
Echoes loud, a thunder sound
Falling skies and burning flame
Nothing ever stays the same

Rise again, the world we hold
Stories new and legends told
Armageddon calls our name
We survive and play the game

Welcome to my world of dreams
Flowing rivers, endless streams
Every star will guide the way
Leading us to brighter day

My world shines with endless light
Colors bold and futures bright
Together we will always stay
In my world we’ll find our way
